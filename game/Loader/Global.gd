-----------------------------SCENE LOADER INSTRUCTION-------------------------------------
- state -> this is the variable that tracks what scene the game is currently in
- You set state to one of the enum states defined in scene
- For example, if you want to change scene to main menu:
  Global.state = Global.scene.MAIN_MENU
- The scene will only change if the process function in Scenes/globalScope/globalScope.gd
  detects that there has been a change in scene
- The paths for all the scenes are also defined in Scenes/globalScope/globalScope.gd
